== The HelloWorld Interoperability Badge

The *HelloWorld Interoperability Badge* Badge is mainly a demonstration badge. It has no official relevance, it is just designed for the sake of this tutorial. A badge is a mainly a named collection of *Interoperability Requirements (IR)*. Each IR is defined by its unique identifier and it has a description explaining the requirement. It is important that the requirement description is unambiguous und testable. The two interoperability requirements are referring to the earlier explained behavior pattern (see <<2-1-hw-federation.adoc#,The Behavior Model>>)

Beside the definition JSON file, a interoperability badge will also have a graphical representation. The figure below shows is an example for such a badge logo. It is of course not a official badge, but only an example how such logo would look like.

=== General Badge Information

Each Interoperability Badge is defined with a unique identifier _HelloWorld-2019_ and a version string _2.0.0_, a short name and a description as a abstract of the badge purpose. It also as a graphics reference to a key visual for the badge.

An important element is the _dependency_ key, which contains a list of badges which are preconditions to the contained interoperability requirements. In the example of the HelloWorld badge, this is the _HLA_BASE_2019_ badge with all basic HLA rules.


=== Interoperability Requirements

An *Interoperability Requirements (IR)* is a definition of a testable behavior pattern, the system under test must comply to. It will be defined with a biunique identifier. This identifier is not just unique within one badge, but has global unambiguousness among all existing badges.

The HelloWorld badge contains two IRs:

* IR-HW-0001: That requirement defines the population growing rate between two update cyles.

* IR_HW_0002: That requirement defines the interaction behavior of a helloWorld federate.
