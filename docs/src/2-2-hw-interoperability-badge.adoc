== The HelloWorld Interoperability Badge

As explained in the HelloWorld federation section, the original definition did not contain any requirements on _correct_ behavior. So anything a helloWorld federate could do or not do, would be fine. It could create a Country object or it could not. It could create one or many objects. It could give them a Name or it could not. It could let the Population grow or shrink. It could send Messages or it could not.

While this is a perfectly reasonable approach to demonstrate the HLA features, it might be not enough to ensure that HelloWorld federates from different developers are building a well interworking federation. If federates shall comply to certain interoperability patterns, it is important that these patterns are unambiguously identified.

For that purpose the IVCTool is using the concept of an *Interoperability Badge*. Such a badge is a named collection of *Interoperability Requirements (IR)*. Each IR is defined by its unique identifier and it has a description explaining the requirement. It is important that the requirement description is unambiguous und testable.

=== General Badge Information

Each Interoperability Badge is defined with a unique identifier _HelloWorld-2019_ and a version string _2.0.0_, a short name and a description as a abstract of the badge purpose. It also as a graphics reference to a key visual for the badge.

An important element is the _dependency_ key, which contains a list of badges which are preconditions to the contained interoperability requirements. In the example of the HelloWorld badge, this is the _HLA_BASE_2019_ badge with all basic HLA rules.


=== Interoperability Requirements

An *Interoperability Requirements (IR)* is a definition of a testable behavior pattern, the system under test must comply to. It will be defined with a biunique identifier. This identifier is not just unique within one badge, but has global unambiguousness among all existing badges.

The HelloWorld badge contains two IRs:

* IR-HW-0001: That requirement defines the population growing rate between two update cyles.

* IR_HW_0002: That requirement defines the interaction behavior of a helloWorld federate.
