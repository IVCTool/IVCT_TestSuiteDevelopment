== The HelloWorld Interoperability Badge


As explained in the HelloWorld federation section, the original definition did not contain any requirements on _correct_ behavior. So anything a helloWorld federate could do or not do, would be fine. It could create a Country object or it could not. It could create one or many objects. It could give them a Name or it could not. It could let the Population grow or shrink. It could send Messages or it could not.

While this is a perfectly reasonable approach to demonstrate the HLA features, it might be not enough to ensure that HelloWorld federates from different developers are building a well interworking federation. If federates shall comply to certain interoperability patterns, it is important that these patterns are unambiguously identified.

For that purpose the IVCTool is using the concept of an *Interoperability Badge*. Such a badge is a named collection of *Interoperability Requirements (IR)*. Each IR is defined by its unique identifier and it has a description explaining the requirement. It is important that the requirement description is unambiguous und testable.
