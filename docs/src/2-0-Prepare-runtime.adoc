== How to Prepare your Development Environment?

Before you can start developing test cases, you need to decide what kind of run-time environment you like to have. There are some restrictions given by the IVCT design, such as the gradle build scripts and the run-time structure. But otherwise you are mostly free on what kind environment you are preferring.

=== Operating System

All IVCT components are pure Java and are tested on Linux and Windows 10.

=== IDE - Integrated Development Environment

IVCT is using the 'gradle' build system (see https://gradle.org/). That's an open source and widely used build system, which is supported by most IDE's. Within the IVCT community Eclipse and Netbeans is used, and we are not aware of any issues with other IDEs.

===  Run-time Folder

The IVCTool requires several configuration files and it creates protocol and report files. They all organized within several folders, where is folder is configurable (see https://github.com/IVCTool/IVCT_Framework/blob/development/docs/src/2-8-IVCT_Configuration.adoc for more details). However, a very typical and recommended structure is shown in the figure below.

- Badges: All badge definition files, as well as the badge key visuals, are stored in that folder. If a new badge shall be included, the user has to add the respective definition files here.
- IVCTsut: The definition and protocol files for System under Tests (SuT) are managed within this folder. It includes a conformance statement for each SuT, along  with subfolders for each test suite including test case parameters protocol files.
- TestSuites: The available test suites are configure within that folder. There is one json file for each test suite.
- TestSuiteDist: The actual implementations for the test suites are collected in that folder. The subfolder structure for each test suite is the same as the distribution, generated by the gradle build.
- IVCT.properties: Additional configurations are possible in a properties file. The location and also the name of that file is provides by the environment variable `IVCT_CONF`.

=== To docker or not to docker?

The build scripts are supporting both, docker-based containerized as well as script based distributions. Code development can be done in both environments, its more a question of you preferences and coding conventions. Docker container are easier to migrate and preferable in multi-operation system environments. While with script based distributions there is just one level of complexity less.
