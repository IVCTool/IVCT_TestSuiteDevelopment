=== Test case classes

- interoperability requirements
- one test case for one requirement: this gives flexibility for combining
- support functions can be integrated

=== Test suites

- combining test cases and support libraries into one project
- compile with gradle,
- automate with travis
- integrate test suites into the IVCTool deployment


=== Containerize test suites

- docker containers
