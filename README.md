# IVCT_TestSuiteDevelopment

The TS_HelloWorld is a sample test suite to explain the concepts for writing test cases for the IVCTool. It includes a small two simple test cases, combined into the TS_HelloWorld test suite, and a simple helloworld federate to run against the test cases.

# Test Case Tutorial

The TS_HelloWorld test case tutorial is supposed to give you some guidance to develop test cases for the IVCTool.

The tutorial starts with an short overview on the basic concepts to give some first ideas on what a test case is and how test cases are organized. It is recommended to start with these sections, before you dive any deeper into the examples.

The second part of the tutorial is dedicated to the HelloWorld test suite example. This is simple but complete test suite to give an example for test case developers to start with. It is recommended to start with a copy of that test suite, if you plan to develop a new test suites.

In the third part of this tutorial there are set of reference documents to give some more background information on interfaces, build scripts, deployments and existing test suites.
